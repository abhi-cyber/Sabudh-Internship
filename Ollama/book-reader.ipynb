It had been almost 6 years then that I had \\nbeen working out on and off, based on what “experts” \\nhave been telling me. However, after marriage, I put \\non a lot of weight! Happens right? Office stress and \\nmanaging the house budget further deteriorated \\nmy condition. I was not able to go to the gym for \\nalmost a year, resulting in my muscle mass getting \\nlost while the fat took a leap forward. However, in \\nNovember 2013, after changing my stressful job, \\nI started going back to the gym again. I weighed \\naround 84kgs with a body fat of about 16%. This was \\nthe time Krish-3 was being promoted in India, and \\nthere were posters of Hrithik Roshan in every nook \\nand corner. Aesthetics were in! I too wanted to get \\nthat chiselled look and beach body which I could \\nhave throughout the year rather than bulking for \\nmonths and then again cutting back for months. I \\nwas tired of that nonsense.\\nSo, I knew right then what I wanted, and I had a target \\nin mind too, but I did not know how to reach there. I \\ndid not have any mentor. All I knew was the typical \\nstuff everyone knew bodybuilding fundas that are \\nprevalent through hearsay for eg., “Creatine is not \\ngood, it damages the liver and causes bloating, and \\nwater retention”, “Heavyweights for gaining mass \\nand lightweight for losing”, “More reps are good for \\ncutting...”\\nAnd other hazy misinformation in circulation. I didn’t \\neven bother questioning these ideas – It had worked \\nfor me so far after all! I had a decent body. Using \\nthose same ideas from hearsay, I knew I had to lean \\nout first to reduce my fat, so I thought to myself, “Let’s \\ndo cardio every day along with weight training.” And'),\n",

While I had shed 11 kgs of body \\nweight, I had lost only 2% body fat! Then what exactly did I lose? Was it muscles??\\nBang on! What I had lost was a lot of muscles! And on top of that, I had messed up my \\nmetabolism, getting to a position where I was barely consuming 1500 calories a day! \\nAnything I was eating was converted to fat, and that made me reduce my calories more and \\nmore to keep off that fat. All in all, it was a vicious cycle I was on, and my physical condition \\nand metabolism kept declining until I came across this article that changed my whole \\nperspective. Once the truth registered in my mind, it gave rise to a tremendous urge to learn \\nmore about how the body responds to food and exercise. Then all I did was read more and \\nmore.

We learn to do the best with whatever we have available in our \\nbudget.\\nBefore getting to it, please understand a few things very clearly:\\n1. Fitness is science. If you’re getting desired results without needing a proper plan for \\nnutrition and workout, then good for you, you can stop reading this document right \\naway.\\n2. To lose weight, you have to take lesser calories than your Total Daily Energy Expenditure \\n(TDEE)*, to gain weight you have to take more calories than that. Simple and logical.\\nThat’s it, and there is absolutely NO WAY around these two guidelines. Let science guide \\nyour transformation journey, not bro-science.\\nI figured the best way to tell you everything would be to start from the start.

So please don’t skip anything and if possible, re-read \\nit multiple times. Good luck!\\nMetabolism\\nYour body is like a car - it needs fuel to run. However, unlike a petrol or diesel car, your body \\ncan use multiple fuels. In simple words, the process in which your body uses the fuel to \\nprovide energy to your body is called Metabolism.\\nThe food contains ingredients which your body can use as fuel. But even this fuel is not yet \\nin the form of energy that can be used immediately! If I give you a fully charged battery, try \\nusing it for baking an egg. Possible? No.\\nHaving an energy-containing fuel does not mean that it is ready to use.\\n It all starts with food, and its Metabolically Active Ingredients -\\n  •      Fat\\n  •      Fiber\\n  •      Long Carbohydrates\\n  •      Short Carbohydrates (Sugar in other words)\\n  •      Protein\\nFat contains 9 calories (kilocalories) per gram, and Carbohydrates and Protein contain 4 \\ncalories per gram each. While fibres do contain about 2 kcals, they are critical in making \\ndigested food leave your body. They help in digestion as well. Here’s a more straight forward'),\n",

What do they comprise?\\nLet’s have a look: -\\n      Your body can extract at least the following three kinds of fuel from \\n     what you ingest:\\nWe know about the fuels now. It’s time to understand how they are stored in the body. \\nDifferent fuels are stored in various forms, amounts and in different locations.\\n1. Fatty acids\\n Almost any cell can store fatty acids, they can also be transported directly in the \\nbloodstream - no conversion is needed. If it turns out that you do not have enough cells \\nto store all fatty acids, your body can quickly generate specialized ‘adipocytes’ (fat cells), \\nwhich put together, form the so-called ‘adipose tissue’. As can easily be observed, the \\nbody easily stores tens of kilos of fat. As each kilo of fat can power an individual for many \\ndays, an average person actually carries enough energy in the form of fat to survive for \\na month. An overweight person often has enough fuel to survive for many months!\\n But hey! All this doesn’t make fat terrible. Just remember, you can survive without carbs, \\nbut without essential fats, your brain will simply stop working. So never ever cut down fat \\nentirely from your diet. You need essential fats every single day for your survival!\\n \\n2.  Glucose\\n Glucose is a tiny molecule and quickly travels from cell to cell. This makes it easily \\ntransportable. This mobility is not very well suited for actually storing sugars, so for \\nstorage, sugars are converted to glycogen. Glycogen is a molecule which consists of \\nsmaller glucose. This size and aggregation make it easier to store glucose.\\n As glycogen, sugar is stored in the liver and in muscles. Both liver and muscles can \\nconvert glucose to glycogen. The liver can convert glycogen back to glucose, but \\nmuscles cannot. Muscles can, however, use glycogen directly if needed, or release it into \\n1g of Fat = 9 Calories\\n1g of Carbohydrates = 4 Calories\\n1g of Protein = 4 Calories\\n1. Fatty Acids\\n2. Glucose\\n3. Amino Acids\\n4. Fat → Fatty Acids\\n5. Fibres (used for excreting ingredients)\\n6. Long carbohydrates → Shorter → Glucose\\n7. Shorter carbohydrates (sugars) → Glucose\\n8. Proteins → Amino Acids'),\n",

While this allows the body to rapidly utilize ingested sugar, what this \\neventually means is that the amount of glucose allowable in the blood can be easily \\nexceeded.\\n People of average weight will generally have in the order of 5 grams of glucose in\\n their blood at any specific time. Levels above 10 grams are considered too high.\\n \\n  This means that a regular candybar, which contains approximately \\n  30 grams of sugar, actually poses a great challenge to the body.\\n \\n When glucose arrives (via the food we eat) over 10 grams, the body releases insulin, \\nwhich instructs the liver and muscles to absorb glucose from the blood. Furthermore, all \\nparts of your body, which can run on glucose start doing so as well. Consequently, the \\nburning of fatty acids for energy production is reduced.\\n Beyond the bloodstream, the body can store a few hundred grams of glucose. Amounts \\ndiffer with the actual body mass and the physical condition of each individual body but \\nare generally in the order of approximately 150 grams. The glucose storage can usually \\nbe depleted in a single day, making it a short-term fuel.\\n Complex carbohydrates cannot be transferred directly to the bloodstream and must be \\nconverted first, which can take quite some time. That is actually a good thing because \\nthis delay ensures that the blood isn’t overflooded with glucose.\\n  Remember, insulin spikes are bad as they indicate that your body\\n  does not need to burn fat. So fat loss stops right there!\\n  \\n3. Proteins and Amino Acids\\n These are found throughout the body, either bunched up as proteins or freely available \\namino acids. They are the building blocks and can be used to form muscle fibres, or \\ncells, or lots of other things, all of which can also be broken down again into proteins or \\neven amino acids. It is a reversible process. Proteins are broken down into amino acids in \\nthe intestine and then brought to the liver, where they are partly reassembled and partly \\nreleased into the bloodstream.\\n \\n Compared to glucose, a lot of protein is available for use at any one time. The blood \\nalone will contain in the order of approximately 100 grams. Compared to either glucose \\nor fatty acids, amino acids also have *vast* uses. It can also be stated that you ARE a \\nsignificant aggregation of amino acids! They make up your DNA and mostly everything \\nelse that is interesting in your body. \\n I know it’s all so scientific, and you’re waiting to get to the part where all the ‘real’ action \\nbegins (the info that you can get your hands dirty with), but hold your horses for that! \\nWhatever actionable items will come, comes precisely out of this scientific information \\nand is built on this information alone. So, don’t make the mistake of skipping these facts \\nand figures! Keep reading.'),\n",

You’ll have to trigger the start button, and that is when the petrol combines \\nwith air and is ignited in the combustion chamber, resulting in the release of a short burst of \\nvery powerful energy which will drive the pistons. In case of body, this energy is called ATP \\n(Adenosine Tri-Phosphate)\\nAs I mentioned earlier, your body stores its energy in the form of the three different fuels. To \\nbe used, these fuels must each be converted to ATP. This can be done in lots of places.\\n Glucose\\n Glucose, stored in the form of glycogen, can be converted into ATP by all cells containing \\nmitochondria, which is the power-producing unit of the cell. Nearly all cells have \\nmitochondria, which means almost all cells can convert glucose into ATP. Muscles can \\neven burn glycogen directly, without needing to convert it first into glucose.\\n \\n Fatty acids\\n Pretty much the same goes for the site of metabolism of fatty acids, with the very notable \\nexception of the brain. Fatty acids cannot cross the barrier into brain cells.\\n \\n The brain, however, uses loads and loads of energy in the form of glucose.\\n \\n Fatty acids, however, can be converted to ketones, which can partly power the brain. But \\nonly partially. It still needs glucose, and that glucose can come from protein breakdown \\n(from your diet, or if you do not ingest enough protein, then by breaking down the \\nmuscles)\\n \\n \\n Amino acids\\n Can be converted by the liver into glucose, or even into fatty acids.\\nAlmost everything can be converted to everything else in the body. But not always\\nand not everywhere. Important conversions are:\\n (A) From Glucose to Glycogen to Stored Fat\\n As mentioned earlier, this is done when your sugar intake has exceeded the storage \\ncapacity. This happens a lot.\\n \\n (B) From Stored Fat to Glucose\\n Creating glucose from non-glucose parts is called Gluconeogenesis, and this is very \\nimportant. It helps power the brain using long-term energy storage (fat).\\nYes, that’s all you need to know about fuels and storage for now. But, the exciting stuff is yet \\nto come. Before that, you might want to know where and how this ATP or energy is used in'),\n",

And what about why you feel hungry even though your body has a lot of stored \\nfat in it?\\nWhy Do I Feel Hungry?\\nWell, energy is clearly spent when you do physical work, but as it turns out, a vast majority \\nof work is latent – it happens anyhow without you noticing it. This energy expenditure is \\nmeasured by what is called the Basic Metabolic Rate(BMR), and trust me, it is a LOT.\\nTo take an example, the body spends energy on pumping your blood around, to different \\nstations. Every hour, about 80 litres of blood pass through your kidneys. Furthermore, the \\nbody needs to do work to keep you warm enough. And then there is the brain, which always \\nrequires a lot of energy to keep background processes running, even if you are not actively \\n‘thinking.’\\nYou’ll be surprised to know that our ‘active’ functions (doing everyday things) actually \\nrequire much less energy as compared to the BMR. However, you can quickly raise your \\nBMR by exercising - while the exercise itself does not really cost a lot of energy, the physical \\ninfrastructure created for it will.\\nThe body does not always expend energy the same way and in equal amounts. \\nThe body’s strategy, in general, appears to be a lot like a modern laptop: to go on as long as \\npossible with the available fuel. Such an approach boils down to spending a lot of energy \\nwhen it is abundant and powering down (battery conservation mode) in its (perceived) \\nabsence. It also means whining for more energy even when a lot is available, just like a \\nlaptop claiming that its battery has run out when in fact it has hours left!\\nTrue, the body appears to have quite an attitude! As mentioned before, most healthy adults \\ncarry enough energy with them to survive at least a month. Most of us, in fact, move around \\nconsiderably more. While ‘surviving’ sounds big, here is what it really means - it could \\nprobably be safely said that not eating for a whole week would not even tax the prowess of \\nour metabolism.\\nYet after skipping lunch, you will probably feel starved by the time you eat dinner. How \\ncome?\\nWell, it’s a strategy. The body appears much attached to its energy stores. So connected that \\nmost of us eat blindly well above our required caloric levels, and grow blissfully overweight \\n- yet still feel hungry if we miss a single meal!\\nStrategy in detail - The strategy employed determines how energy is spent in the body, and \\nhow a demand for more is created. The demand part is natural.\\nWhenever the body runs short of one kind of fuel, it sends unmistakable signals that you \\nshould eat, even though it could also deal with the situation by conversion of another \\nplentiful source into energy. Talk about greed!\\nRegarding energy expenditure, the human body is generally described to be in any of these'),\n",

When asleep at night, for instance, the body \\nis fasting. (Which is why we take ‘break-fast’). Starvation only occurs when eating does not \\nhappen for an extended period.\\nNow, when food has not arrived for a while, the body starts conserving energy in preparation \\nof perceived hard times ahead. There are a lot of ways to do so -\\nLowering the body temperature a bit, neglecting body maintenance, slowing down the \\nbrain etc.\\nThis was about Food and Energy, and it was vital for you to know.\\nWe’ve been discussing food for so long now, aren’t you wondering where water comes into \\nthe picture?\\nRole of Water\\nLet’s start by discussing blood. The blood serves as a medium for taking fuel to the cells, \\nbut it also works to transport away stuff the cells have discarded. What this means is, if left \\nuncleansed of these waste products, the bloodstream would quickly become polluted. So, \\nat least three organs are working on cleaning it up: the two kidneys and the liver.\\nThe Kidneys function primarily as sophisticated filters. As long as things are kept wet enough, \\nthey can remove waste from the blood by osmosis. This waste may be further treated and \\nis eventually sent to the bladder for excretion out of the body.\\nThe Liver is a much more complex organ capable of advanced-level functions. It actually \\nconverts a lot of waste products into usable substances again. It can also break down \\nmolecules which cannot be filtered by the kidneys. Almost all energy conversions taking \\nplace in your body are centred around the liver.\\nThe kidneys primarily need water to function - they need to be wetter than your blood. If that \\ndoes not happen, the waste-laden blood is not filtered, and the job is left for the liver. The \\nliver then becomes occupied doing that and has less time or capacity left for conversions. \\nWhen this occurs, the body may actually enter a ‘starvation’ state. The liver is unable to \\nfurnish the brain with sugar, and no other energy sources are available. This quickly leads to \\ndizzy spells and general incompetence.\\nEffectively, what this indicates is the overwhelming importance of staying hydrated. Water is \\na brilliant blessing to our body, although most of us seldom realize its significance. Staying \\nhydrated has tremendous health benefits. Not just for your skin, or your metabolism, or your \\ndigestion, but for optimal functioning of vital body processes.'),\n",

All the science we have discussed is no good if \\nwe cannot put it to some good use for our own benefit. Here are a few pointers I would like \\nto state outright:\\nTo lose weight, we must make sure that the following conditions are met:\\n• Energy intake must be decreased from maintenance levels, and energy has to be used \\nand not stored in the body.\\n• Energy use must not be diminished at any time. Instead, it should be increased through \\nefforts.\\n• Stored fuels should be able to deliver the missing energy that the body needs.\\n• The body is a simple container - to lose weight, more energy must be expended than is \\nadded. If done wrong, eating severely less (starving yourself) will actually increase your \\nweight in the long run!\\n• Drinking plenty of water will actually allow the liver to do the conversions and burn fat, so \\nif you look at it this way, drinking more water does help burn fat.\\nI have divided the book into three main parts, Nutrition, Training and Supplements. I will \\ndiscuss nutrition first, then training, finally followed by supplements in the order of their \\nimportance.'),\n",

Most of the food we \\nconsume has a label indicating both macro (Protein, Carbohydrates, Fibre and Fat) and \\nmicronutrient content (Vitamins, Minerals).\\nLean Mass Calculation\\nNow we all know how to calculate our BMR, but it is to be noted that before calculating the \\nBMR, we should see the value of our body fat. Basically, our body fat percentage decides if \\nwe need to calculate our BMR by considering our total body weight or our lean body mass. \\nLean Body Mass is basically the fat-free mass in our body. It’s also not your muscle mass so \\nkindly don’t get confused between the two. Generally, if your body’s fat percentage is more \\nthan 20 (in case of men)/28 (in case of women), it is advised to consider the lean mass to \\ncalculate the BMR.\\nThere is a straightforward formula that is being used to calculate the lean mass, i.e.:\\nLean Mass = Total Body Weight – (Body Fat % x Total Body Weight).\\nFor example, if a person is weighing 100 kgs and has body fat % of 40, then his lean mass \\nwould be 100 – (0.40 x 100) = 60kgs. So the above person should calculate the BMR by \\nputting his lean mass, i.e. 60kgs instead of total body weight\\ni.e. 100kgs.\\nNow I’d be giving out my personal diet but what worked for me, might not necessarily be \\nworking for you.\\nYou know the saying “give a man a fish, you feed him once, teach a man how to fish, and \\nyou feed him for a lifetime”. I am going to do the latter. Many people are going to hate me \\nfor this.\\nI will discuss the following diets.

It engages your body in producing more \\nketones (will discuss in the diet sections) hence the name, Keto Diet. It is an ideal diet to \\nstart with if your goal is fat loss but would be sub-optimal for muscle gain.\\nI will also cover carb loading In brief. However, it is a very complex subject and a lot of \\nresearch is still going on about it.\\n Warning: Depletion diet requires immense knowledge and understanding about body \\ncomposition and should only be attempted if you’re an advanced level athlete and \\nare below 10% body fat. It can screw up your metabolism if done wrong, not to mention \\ncausing muscle loss and hormonal imbalance.\\nBefore you start planning your diet, you have to calculate your BMR, as mentioned before. \\nFigure out how many calories you’re going to consume to reach your target goal and then \\nbased on the diet, you have to divide your macronutrients into ratios.\\n Remember, the BMR we calculated above only provides a baseline, many people have \\nthe metabolic rate above it or under it and therefore BMR should not be considered a \\nuniversal indicator of one’s metabolic rate.\\nLow Carb Diet\\nSince we’re looking to get shredded with low carb diet, our Fat:Carbs: Protein Ratio should be \\nlow in carbs and balanced protein and fats depending on the rest of our intake. A 40:25:35 \\nF:C:P ratio is decent for this in most cases. Of course, there will be a slight variation, but that \\nis fine. It’s just to give you an idea and stress on the fact that your carb intake will be the \\nlower while fat intake will be the highest (keeping protein constant).\\nHow does it help? Fats help in satiety. And this diet will help you to stay satiated, with enough \\nfibre of course. Also, it’s suitable for anyone who’s insulin resistant or diabetic (more on this'),\n",

How many calories you need to \\nreduce? It’s up to you. However, the body does not like dramatic changes, and it retaliates \\ndramatically, leading to loose skin, water retention etc. (will address these problems in \\nlater part). It’s better to lose weight gradually than dramatically. So I’d suggest a cut of \\n200-300 calories in the first couple of weeks to start noticing a change. And then further \\ndown by 400-500 in subsequent weeks to start fat loss and turn the body into a fat-burning \\nmachine. You should never reduce more than 1000 calories, as it would most probably slow \\ndown your metabolism.\\nProtein has 4, Carb has 4 and Fat has 9 calories per gram.\\nSo if I were to receive 2000 calories in a day, I would use the macro ratio of 40:25:35 to calculate \\nmy macro in grams.

You can enter rate manually \\nas well, in my case, I calculated using the above formula.

They appear big at any point of time as \\nthey are holding a lot of glycogen and water in them. Generally, 100 gm of your lean muscle \\ntissue will hold up to 2 gm of glycogen, and each of these 2gm of glycogen will further \\nassociate itself with around 3 grams of water.\\nSo if a person has 30kg of lean muscle tissue, i.e. 30,000gm of muscle tissue, the muscles \\nwill store up to 600gm of glycogen which will further store 600x3= 1800gm of water. That’s \\n1.8 kg of water. \\nPeople who start with a depletion diet often get confused when they see their weight \\ndropping initially. It is this water glycogen weight that shows a massive drop initially. Even \\nthough there is no fat loss, you can lose up to 2 to 5 kg of your body weight at the beginning \\nof the diet depending on your lean muscle tissue and water storage capacity.\\nFeeling a bit disappointed? You shouldn’t be! It is actually not a bad thing. If you are into \\ncontest prep, you will realize how this water and glycogen manipulation can make you \\nstand out in the crowd (Has to do with bodybuilding. Others can ignore).\\nWell, let’s get deeper.\\nSo now you know that proper fat loss is not really an easy game and to start seeing any \\nresults, you will have to get your basics right. And that my friends, is the main idea behind \\nany diet, be it Atkins diet, or low carb diet.\\nOne way of doing that would be to gradually reduce the caloric intake. But returning to \\ndepletion diet, the goal would be to gradually reduce the carb intake every week or few \\ndays, so that eventually our consumption is less than 20 gm per day, and simultaneously, \\nwe’ll be supplementing with enough protein to make sure muscle loss is minimum. And \\ndon’t worry if your muscles appear flat, it’s because your muscles are getting rid of the \\nexcess glycogen and water. They will fill out once you’re back to your regular routine.\\nAlso, the initial few days of carb depletion will be very challenging as your body will struggle'),\n",

You have to remember, ‘calorie deficit’ is the only \\nprinciple that is followed if we talk about fat loss. And, sustainability is a major factor in \\nyour dieting journey. So, I am providing you with the information here and you are the \\nbest judge to decide whether to go for it or not.\\nThis has been a real hype in recent years.

This will force the body to utilize fat as a primary source of fuel, thereby \\naiding fat loss. Remember the car and the fuel example? There are different variations of \\nKeto. One that is worth noting is the Atkin’s version. In this version of Keto, you basically eat \\nfat to burn fat. This is particularly good for people who face adherence issues when on a \\ndiet with carbs as keto forces you to stay strict to be in ketosis, a state where your body uses \\nketones and fatty acids as a source of fuel instead of glucose (although your brain always \\nneeds a supply of glucose to function. We’ll talk about that later). Let’s discuss the Atkins \\nversion of Keto along with a sample diet plan.\\nFor Atkins, I suggest you use the 5:35:60 macro ratio, i.e. 5 portions of Carbs, 35 portions of \\nProtein and 60 portions of Fat.\\nIf you know your BMR, you can calculate your macro breakdown from FITTR app.\\nNow, for example, my BMR is around 1500 and my TDEE (total daily energy expenditure is \\n2000), so my macro breakdown for Keto will be:'),\n",

In the subsequent 16 hours, you can take \\nsolid meals like rice, chicken, pasta, oats and anything else you want. The amount of \\ncarbs that you need to bring depends on your lean body weight. The typical formula is \\nto have around 6-8 gm per kg of your lean body weight, so for a 70kg guy with 10% bf, \\nthat would come at around 500-600gms of carbs. However, this formula is highly flawed \\nand can often lead to excess carbs. Instead, I’d suggest eating 50gm carbs every 2 \\nhours in the next 16 hours and see how your body reacts. \\n \\n On SUNDAY morning, you should look fuller, more defined and more muscular. If you are \\nholding water, or you are looking flat, it means, either the carbs were too less, or they \\nwere too many. So it takes a little trial and error to hit the right amount. It will take some \\npractice.\\n On Sunday you can either continue to load carbs or if you have had too many on Saturday \\nand are holding water, then do some cardio to burn off the excess calories, and you can \\nswitch to keto or eat carbs at your maintenance calories. Some people make use of the \\nperiod and do cheats as well, which is fine since everything you eat is primarily used by \\nyour body to fill up your depleted glycogen stores. So sweets, ice-creams, candies, cookies, \\nbiryani etc. are all allowed, however, make sure your total fat intake on these 1-2 days is less \\nthan 15% of your maintenance calories.

If during normal state your muscles stored 2gm of glycogen per 100gm \\nof lean muscle tissue, after depletion it can store up to 4gm of glycogen and hence more \\nwater. Bodybuilders and athletes take advantage of this situation. Following a depletion \\ndiet, they start carb loading, which lets them appear fuller and huge on stage and all the \\ncarb will get used up to fill increased glycogen levels. Also, a lot of subcutaneous (under the \\nskin) water will be pulled into the muscles giving a dry and ripped look. However, this only \\nworks for people who are below a body fat% of 10 or less, as it won’t make a difference if you \\nhave more fat mass.\\nNot all Carbs are the same\\nNot all Calories are the same\\nAgreed it’s the calories at the end of the day that matters when it comes to weight loss or \\nweight gain, but choosing to ignore the right source because you read some new research \\nor an article by some of the leading names in the industry may actually not be beneficial \\nfor your ultimate goals.

Far from it indeed.\\nSo people professing that eating Dal Chawal, mixing carbs and fats, eating sweets is allowed \\nbecause it is within their TDEE. Here’s something that might burst your bubble:\\nNot all calories are treated in the same way by the body, for, eg. Both fructose and glucose \\nyield 4 calories per gm, but they are very different when it comes to being metabolized by \\nthe body. Fats have a different metabolic pathway so do amino acids, and mind you all this \\nis conditional, based on various circumstances, the usage in the body can change.\\nOne such example is the ghrelin levels. Ghrelin is your hunger hormone. When it is up, it \\nmakes you feel hungry. Different foods have different effects on ghrelin levels, while foods \\ncontaining fructose or glucose will trigger more ghrelin levels and will make you eat more \\ncompared to proteins or fats.

A slight increase in weight while reverse \\ndieting does not necessarily mean that you are adding fat.\\n That will not happen unless you go beyond your maintenance Calories or overlook \\nmacro distribution. This slight increase in weight will be intracellular water retention or \\ngain in muscle glycogen. For example, if you are on a calorie deficit diet for weight loss, \\nyou start off by preparing a diet chart with calories equal to your BMR, suppose your BMR = \\n1600 calories, and you are following a low carb diet so you would start with calculating \\nyour macros for 1600 calories, i.e. 25:45:30 – C/P/F.

What you are actually doing is you are \\nharming your metabolism. This is true for most people who tend to lose weight by doing a \\nstarvation or crash diet. And they gain the weight back again very soon. \\nIf you do the diets mentioned above correctly, you will see that your metabolism will only \\nget better, you may even keep losing weight despite higher calorie intake.

Unfortunately, there is \\nno direct answer. I am going to explain how it all works and then maybe you can figure out \\nwhat would work better for you. I’ll also tell you my personal training regime and how it was \\nbetter than others.\\nThere are a lot of factors that matter when it comes to building muscles or losing fat, ranging \\nfrom body type to genetics and whatnot. Different type of sports would require you to have \\ndifferent bodies, however since we’re into building muscles and losing fat, I’ll only discuss \\ntraining which will be relevant to that.\\nStarting with body type, we have three major classifications:\\n1. Ectomorph\\n An ectomorph is the typical skinny guy. Ectomorphs have a light build with small joints and \\nlean muscle. Usually, ectomorphs have long thin limbs with stringy muscles. Shoulders \\ntend to be weak with little width.\\n \\n2.  Mesomorph\\n A mesomorph has a large bone structure, large muscles and a naturally athletic \\nphysique. Mesomorphs are the best body type for bodybuilding as they find it quite easy \\nto gain and lose weight. They are usually strong, which makes for the perfect platform to \\nbuild muscle.\\n \\n3. Endomorph\\n The endomorph body type is solid and generally soft. Endomorphs gain fat very quickly. \\nEndomorphs are usually of a shorter build with thick arms and legs. Muscles are strong, \\nespecially the upper legs. Endomorphs find they are naturally healthy in leg exercises \\nlike the squat.\\nNow don’t be disheartened if you are an ectomorph or endomorph, I am an endomorph, \\njust saying! You must be thinking, ‘yeah so there is endo, ecto blah blah, who cares, where’s \\nmy workout routine?’ Well, hold your horses, Leonidas, we are getting there. It is essential to \\nunderstand a few things before you go there.\\nSince your primary goal is to build (or maintain) muscles, you need to understand them'),\n",

You cannot keep doing squats and expect to get a right chest- I \\nknow that is obvious and it is not what I am trying to say, what I mean to say is that the \\nweight, the repetitions, the intensity and the form, all these are the factors that play an \\nessential part in giving the proper stimulus to any muscle group. So if you were going to ask \\nshould I lift heavy weight and do fewer reps or lift lightweight and do more reps, read what \\nI just said again. There is no single answer, and no one size fits all here. Different athletes \\nin the history of bodybuilding have shown and proved that you can build a great body by \\nfollowing different methods.\\nFrank Zane (three-time Mr.Olympia) used to believe in lifting smaller weights and doing \\nmore repetition while more recent bodybuilders like Jay Cutler, Phil Heath and so on are \\nproponents of lifting heavy. The article written below becomes all the more relevant now, \\nread it to find why.\\nMuscle Fibre Types\\nThough muscles are muscles, their composition can vary. It can have different\\nproportions of two different kinds of muscle fibres – slow-twitch and fast-twitch.\\nSo your body has bundles of muscle fibres, and these bundles have varying proportions of \\nthese two types of fibres.\\n1. Slow Twitch\\n These are also known as Type1 or red muscle fibres. They are responsible for long-\\nduration, low-intensity activity such as walking or any other aerobic exercise.\\n \\n2. Fast Twitch\\n These are known as Type 2 or white muscle fibres (divided further into A and B). They are \\nresponsible for short-duration, high-intensity activity.\\nfirst. The following chart shows an overview of different types of muscles in the body:'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'book.pdf', 'page': 34, 'page_label': '35'}, page_content='|  35  \\n Type 2B fibres are built for an explosive, very short-duration activity such as Olympic lifts. \\nType 2A fibres are designed for short to moderate duration, moderate-to-high intensity \\nwork, as is seen in most weight training activities.\\nBy looking at elite athletes in different sports, you can see extreme examples of each make-\\nup of muscle fibre. At the slow-twitch end is the endurance athlete, such as the marathon \\nrunner.\\nThese athletes can have up to 80% or more of slow-twitch muscle fibres in their bodies, \\nmaking them extremely efficient over long distances. At the fast-twitch end is the sprinter. \\nWorld-class sprinters can have up to 80% or more of fast-twitch muscle fibres in their body, \\nmaking them extremely fast, strong and powerful but with limited endurance.\\nHow To Train Your Muscle Fibre Type?\\nWhen you’re training with weights, your goal is to work as many muscle fibres as possible. \\nTargeting more muscle fibres means more significant gains in strength and muscle mass.\\nIf your fibres in a particular muscle consist primarily of slow-twitch fibres, to affect the \\nhighest number of those muscle fibres, you’ll need to train that muscle with higher reps, \\nshorter rest periods and higher volume. This is because they take longer to fatigue, they \\nrecover quickly, and they require more work to maximize growth.\\nUnfortunately, slow-twitch muscle fibres are limited in their potential for growth so even \\nif a muscle group is a primarily slow twitch, you should definitely include some lower rep \\ntraining to maximize the fast-twitch fibres you’ve got in that muscle.\\nIf you find you have a hard time gaining size in a particular muscle, it could be because \\nit has a predominance of slow-twitch muscle fibres. Higher reps (e.g.12to15reps), higher \\nvolume (more sets) and shorter rest periods (30 seconds to a minute between sets) can \\nhelp you to maximize those muscles.\\nThis doesn’t mean you should use lightweight, though. You should still strive to use weights \\nthat are as heavy as possible that will cause you to reach failure in those higher rep ranges. \\nIf you don’t use heavyweights, you won’t give your muscles a reason to grow.\\nIf your fibres in a particular muscle group consist primarily of fast-twitch muscle fibres, \\nyou’re one of the lucky ones. You’ll have a much easier time building mass in that muscle - \\nfast-twitch muscle fibres have more significant potential for size than slow twitch. The more \\nfast-twitch fibres you’ve got, the greater your ultimate muscle size can be. These muscles \\nare most likely the strongest and quickest to develop.\\nTo maximize your muscles with fast-twitch fibres, you’ll need to train with low to moderate \\nreps (e.g. 4 to 8 reps), rest period so far around 1 to 2 minutes and a reasonable training \\nvolume (too much volume will compromise recovery).'),\n",

For me, it’s a mix of heavy and light weights. I will do \\na heavyweight session at 4-6 rep range followed with a\\nlightweight (not as light as you might be thinking *wink*) session at 8-10 rep range, alternating \\nweekly.\\nFollow these tips for optimum results:\\n• Use drop sets and supersets as tools for more volume in the workout. Volume is all that \\nmatters.\\n• Personally, I’d do more inclined chest press as it will build your overall chest\\n• Like I said, the volume is the key. Instead of doing 4 sets of 12-15 reps, try doing 6-8 sets \\nof 4-6 reps each\\n• The form is everything.\\n• Tip - Try to retract your shoulder blades when doing a chest press. This will minimize the \\nload on your shoulders and maximize the load on your chest.\\n• Follow a 1:3 approach,1 second to pick the weight up and 3 seconds to bring it down \\nslowly\\n• Do it slow and do it with proper form\\n• Use dumbbells wherever possible instead of barbells. It will isolate each side.\\n• Weighted pull-ups are one of the best exercises; do it every day. Even if you can do one, \\ndo it with strict form.\\n• With back, its mostly pull, so you have to lift heavy enough weights.\\n• Try to avoid exercises which could hurt your neck, Lat pulldown behind the neck is a big \\nno-no.\\n• Use compound movements\\n• Focus on your negatives and try to hold the weight, Mind-Muscle Connection.\\n• Do heavy lifting, but not ego lifting.\\n• Don’t overlook calves and hamstrings.

They are beneficial for your overall cardiovascular health, i.e. your heart and your \\nrespiratory system. Cycling, running on a treadmill, or cross-fit trainer are a few examples \\nof cardio. Cardio can be done once or multiple times throughout the week. However, doing \\ncardio for weight loss is not a suitable option for various reasons. Rather change your diet.\\nResearch has shown doing regular cardio can significantly improve your cardiovascular \\nhealth; however, it should not be used for dropping inches off your body. From my personal \\nexperience, weight training is the best way to do it. Also, fat loss, like we discussed, is a \\nmatter of calories in vs calories out. So revisit your diet.\\nHIIT Vs Steady State Cardio\\nHIIT or high-intensity interval training is basically a training split in which your resting periods \\nare smaller. An example would be to run on a treadmill for 2 minutes at 15kmph and then \\ntaking a gap of 1 minute and then running again. HIIT assists in gaining muscles and is \\nshown to increase your metabolism over 24 hours.\\nHIIT is fueled by both glycogen and fat and will not target fat immediately. Some researchers \\nhave proved, however, that doing HIIT will help you reduce more overall calories in a shorter \\namount of time than steady-state cardio. The scientific logic for this is EPOC. (No in the \\nscope here) \\nMy Opinion?\\nHIIT is badass and does what it claims. However, it is pretty exhaustive!\\nSteady-state cardio is cardio done in 70-75% of your maximum heart rate range. It taps \\nyour fat for energy and is very useful for dropping the last few pounds before a show. You \\ncan still do it for overall good cardiovascular health but do not expect magic!\\nUse cardio for improving your cardiovascular health. You are not going to build any muscle \\nwhile on cardio and remember, the more muscles you have, the more fat you burn even \\nwhile you’re resting, so it’s your call to make.\\nIf you’re looking for a personal training regimen, I’d suggest downloading the Bodyspace \\napp, it is a free app from bodybuilding.com and has more than 40000 training programs. \\nLook for High-Intensity Volume Training program by FITTR.\\nMY BEST EXCUSE FOR AVOIDING CARDIO FOR FATLOSS!'),\n",

Paid my annual \\nfees and from the next day itself, I started with 40 minutes of cardio utilizing all three of the \\ndifferent equipment for cardio and after that proceeded for 45 minutes more of weight \\ntraining, because “big biceps are more important”.

Moreover, those figures on the equipment that displayed “calories \\nburnt” felt like they were the right estimates, and they may even have been right. But when \\nI looked at myself in the mirror, there were no ‘cuts’ or ‘blown up biceps’. It felt like the obese \\naunty in the cardio room (who used the bicycle while talking on the phone) had the same \\nprogress as I had. This nonsense started getting to me now, and then I started reading more \\nand more articles, research papers joined all the bodybuilding groups and asked people for \\ntheir advice who had gone through the same situation.\\nDiet was the apparent answer to all my queries. But that is something all the members of \\nSQUATS are aware of by now. So let me emphasize more on what cardio does and does \\nnot do, what can be its substitute for improving your cardiovascular health and most \\nimportantly, to burn your fats.\\nWHY ISN’T CARDIO THE FIRST OPTION FOR FAT LOSS?\\nThe basic idea behind doing cardio for losing fats for an average Joe is, you burn more \\ncalories and hence your total caloric expenditure is more than your caloric intake, and this \\nisn’t wrong by any means. But do we know from where our body is making arrangements \\nfor these calories needed? Yeah, some fats are burned\\nhere, but after a short while, your body starts breaking muscles for converting them into \\nglucose which will be used as energy by the body. There was a study done where subjects \\nwere examined for 4 months where one group did low-intensity cardio while the other did \\nhigh-intensity interval cardio for 4 months, and it was concluded that there was a significant \\nloss of muscle mass in the subjects that did the low-intensity cardio whereas, surprisingly, \\nthere was a slight increase in the muscle mass in the subjects doing high-intensity interval \\ncardio.\\nNow, this muscle loss will further bring down your metabolism because muscles eat up \\nenergy, and since you are burning your muscles, less energy will be expended.\\nWhy does this happen? Because the cortisol levels increase in your body when you perform \\nlow-intensity cardio. Cortisol is a stress hormone which mainly causes muscle breakdown \\nwhen cardio is done in isolation without any resistance training.\\n• Low-intensity cardio is where you jog at a moderate to low speeds for a prolonged \\nduration\\n• High-intensity cardio is where you run at your highest speed, and it becomes interval \\ncardio when you add periodic intervals in between.\\nWHAT IS THE ALTERNATIVE TO CARDIO THEN, you ask?\\nHere are two options before you:'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'book.pdf', 'page': 38, 'page_label': '39'}, page_content='|  39  \\n• Strength training and low intensity steady state cardio: \\n Strength training and cardio both can help. ST helps in retaining muscle or even better, \\nbuilding muscle. Cardio will help in additional fat loss apart from helping with improving \\ncardiovascular health.\\n  \\n• Strength training and high intensity interval training:\\n This needs a detailed explanation. Let us begin.\\nNow, when you’re doing low-intensity cardio, you start breathing faster because you need \\nmore energy and your body derives this energy by sending oxygen to your muscles causing \\nthe muscles to break down into glucose and then providing you with the energy. But when \\nyou’re doing HIIT or strength training, your body needs the energy faster. It simply cannot \\nwait for the oxygen anymore. Here the body causes an increase in the levels of lactate. \\nGlucose breaks down to pyruvate, which further converts to lactate. Now, this goes to the \\nliver and converts into glucose. \\n[Glucose > pyruvate > lactate >glucose = energy]\\nBut hey! Glucose is again used here like it was used in LISS, so how are we sparing the muscles \\nhere? The thing is, unlike in the former, here not only will your cortisol levels be elevated, but \\neven your Growth Hormone and Testosterone levels go up. And in this environment, your \\nbody will burn fat and not the muscles!\\nOne more advantage in HIIT is that, as the lactate levels go up, the capacity of your muscles \\nto go on for some more time comes down. There is an upper limit for the presence of \\nlactate too. In HIIT, we go above that limit when we are running at the highest pace. Even if \\nwe stop or start walking suddenly, the brain is under the impression that the lactate levels \\nare over the top. So, in effect to this, the ability of our muscles to go on comes down. Now, \\nthis prevents us from overtraining too which otherwise would cause a breakdown of the \\nmuscles.\\nThe environment in your body is different in LISS and HIIT. For, eg. Let’s relate this action of \\n‘running’ to rain. When it rains in a drought-prone area like Rajasthan, it’s a boon, whereas if \\nit rains in places where floods are frequent like in Assam, it’s not that great, is it? Precisely the \\nsame is the case here. When you ‘run’, cortisol levels go up, but when it’s done HIIT style, it’s \\nlike rain in Rajasthan; the situation is ideal as testosterone and growth hormone levels are \\nhigh too resulting in just the fat loss. It’s not the same in LISS. That’s like rain in Assam, where \\nyou will save water in the dam and similarly here you will burn fats surely, but there will be \\nmore significant destruction like loss of some muscle mass.\\nSo how to do HIIT?\\nIn HIIT you run at your highest speed for 30-45 seconds (this may vary with person to person) \\nand then stop or walk for a minute or so and repeat. I bet my ass that you cannot do this \\nfor half as long as you did low-intensity cardio. This is still just an example. You can do HIIT \\nin quite a lot of different ways.'),\n",

Instead, give 100% in your diet and training efforts.\\nHere, I’ll only cover the most basic and most essential supplements.\\nProtein\\nNot going to discuss this! You need this no matter how proper your diet is, don’t fall for \\nexpensive isolates though, blends are good too.\\nHow much? 1.6-1.8 gm per kg of lean bodyweight is decent.\\nCreatine\\nIt gives you more energy to lift! Quite literally!\\nWhen lifting heavy weights, your body primarily uses ATP and CP (Creatine phosphate) \\nstores, however, these are very limited and you cannot push any further until body makes \\nmore ATP from glycogen again. Also, most of these ATP actually exists in the body in the \\nform of ADP (adenosine diphosphate). When Creatine monohydrate is introduced in the \\nbody, it binds to the phosphorus inside the body and exists as Creatine phosphate. Now \\nthis Creatine phosphate during heavy workouts gives its phosphate to ADP to form ATP, this \\nhappens much faster than glycogen to ATP conversion; thereby, there’s a notable increase \\nin your strength.\\nCreatine is one of the most well-researched supplements available in the market and \\nshould be used by anyone who lifts the weight.\\nNow there’s a common myth among bodybuilding community, that Creatine retains water. \\nSo let’s address that. First of all, what do you mean by water retention? The water is stored \\nin your muscle cells as well as outside of your muscle cells under the skin.\\nThis extracellular water stored under the skin is called Water Retention. It’s a defence \\nmechanism employed by the body to keep you hydrated all the time. Now Creatine draws \\nwater directly into the muscles and not into the extracellular skin, which is a good thing. Tell \\nthis to the experts, and they’ll be rolling their eyes now. Most of the time, these people stop \\ndrinking water altogether and stop consuming sodium as well. Now sodium is one primary \\nelectrolyte that helps in the regulation of water in the body. When the body detects low \\nlevels of sodium and water, the hormone aldosterone is triggered, which further as a part of \\nbody’s defence mechanism tries to hang onto the water, thereby causing water retention \\nintracellular as well as extracellular. And people thought it was due to Creatine.'),\n",

BCAA or branched-chain amino acids are basically essential amino acids which \\nare synthesized in the body, namely leucine, isoleucine and valine along with many other \\namino acids. However, what makes these BCAA’s more important is the role they play. These \\namino acids are being used by the body for energy when you’re lifting heavyweights. And if \\nthe body starts making these amino acids, it will not manufacture other amino acids at the \\nsame speed. And we know that all the amino acids are required for building proteins which \\nare nothing but chains of amino acids. So, it is a good idea to supplement these essential \\namino acids. This gives the body enough time to make all other amino acids, further leading \\nto more muscle protein synthesis. However, if your protein intake for the day is sufficient, \\nthen you do not need to supplement with BCAA.\\nZMA\\nZMA or Zinc Magnesium Aspartate is a mineral supplement that is a combination of \\nZinc Monomethionine Aspartate, Magnesium Aspartate and Vitamin B6. The reason ZMA \\nhas become popular amongst athletes is because it supplements mainly with zinc and \\nmagnesium, which is studied to be deficient in people who train.\\nZinc has been proven to be vital for the activity of more than 300 enzymes. Zinc containing \\nenzymes aid in macronutrient metabolism and cell replication, which as we know are key \\nbiochemical functions that correspond to recovery and growth. Zinc has shown to have \\npositive effects on anabolic hormone profile, particularly testosterone. It increases free \\nserum testosterone levels which is particularly important in older men as their testosterone \\nlevels start to decline with age.\\nMicronutrients\\nYour Multivitamin/multimineral tabs. They come cheap, and it’s a good idea to take them.\\nYou may not realize this, but if your diet doesn’t have chromium in it, you will suffer poor \\nmetabolism. How?\\nLet me explain, even though chromium is required in micrograms, it is an essential cofactor \\nfor the proper functioning of your hormone insulin. And you know how vital insulin is. This is \\njust one example showing how essential these micronutrients in your body can be. There \\nare more than 26 vitamins and minerals that are required for optimum health by your body \\nevery day.\\nUnfortunately, there is no single food that will provide you with the full spectrum. Hence \\nsupplementation becomes all the more essential. Multivitamins and minerals tabs can do \\nthat for you.\\nHaving a balanced diet can take care of most of the micronutrients however\\nsupplementation of the following is always beneficial and is even recommended:'),\n",

Remember \\nthey are required by your brain. Similarly, garlic is a very beneficial herb.\\nWhy supplement with ZMA?\\nIt is not really necessary if you have ample intake of these minerals from your diet. But if not, \\nyou might want to consider its use. Lower levels of zinc and magnesium are either due to \\nsweating while training where you lose a lot of minerals and electrolytes or due to poor diet.\\nZMA improves sleep- studies show that people suffering from mild to moderate insomnia \\nseem to improve with oral magnesium therapy. Long term sleep deprivation causes \\nmagnesium deficiency and improving the magnesium intake can help with sleep. ZMA \\nenhances REM (rapid eye movement) cycles of the rest. The better your sleep, the more you \\nrecover and assimilate nutrients.\\nThe list goes on; I’d suggest stick with the basics.

I won’t be going deep into the endocrine system, but it will be \\nhelpful to you to get the basics of a few essential hormones right.\\nSo what are hormones?\\nHormones are special chemical messengers that pass messages between different parts \\nof your body and control various essential functions in your body.

Insulin:\\n IInsulin has always been propagated as the muscle-building hormone and even as the fat-\\nstoring hormone. Truth is, it does both, and you don’t need to fret much about it. It’s a hormone \\nthat helps you stay stable, by keeping your blood glucose levels stable when it tends to rise due \\nto incoming carb intake. It “opens up” the cells to take the incoming glucose in.\\n Insulin is a hormone made by the pancreas that allows your body to use sugar (glucose) from \\ncarbohydrates in the food that you eat for energy or to store glucose for future use.

However, sugar cannot go into most of your \\ncells directly. After you eat food and your blood sugar level rises, cells in your pancreas \\n(known as beta cells) are signalled to release insulin into your bloodstream. Insulin then \\nattaches to and signals cells to absorb sugar from the blood. Insulin is often described \\nas a “key,” which unlocks the cell to allow sugar to enter the cell and be used for energy. \\n2. Glucagon:\\n We discussed how insulin helps keep the blood glucose level stable by assisting the \\nbody to take in excess glucose. Glucagon does the exact opposite by helping the blood \\nglucose to remain stable by bringing in a supply of glucose when blood glucose is \\nlow, by breaking down the stored glycogen in the liver. So insulin and glucagon are \\ninterlinked, and it’s no surprise that both of them are produced in the pancreas itself. \\n3. Testosterone:\\n Now testosterone is the primary male hormone which gives men their “male” \\ncharacteristic, from voice to facial hair. It helps maintain proper health in men and \\nalso helps to build muscles. Now testosterone is a male hormone, but it doesn’t mean \\nthat women don’t produce it. Even women produce it, but much lesser than men. \\nWomen are more sensitive to this hormone. A healthy testosterone level is essential \\nfor you to for proper muscle gain and fat loss. So make sure your micronutrients are \\non point and that you are not a hypocaloric diet for long. (Note – there is a difference \\nbetween calorie deficit and hypocaloric. The hypocaloric diet here means severe \\ndeficit for a long time.) The best testosterone booster in nature is lifting heavyweights. \\nIf you lift weights, your testosterone production gets better, thereby aiding in muscle \\nbuild up and strength gains (in women, “toning” is essentially muscle build-up \\nitself, along with fat loss. Lifting weights will help you do that instead of aerobics) \\n4. Estrogen:\\n Estrogen is the female counterpart of testosterone. It makes a woman, a woman. It is \\nresponsible for the development and regulation of the female reproductive system \\nand secondary sex characteristics. Now, there are different types of estrogen, too, \\nbut that is beyond the scope of this book for now. One thing to remember here is, it is \\nan essential hormone for women. And lifting weights will NOT bring it down to affect \\nyour health. Another concern among men is about the increase of estrogen in their \\nbodies due to soya consumption. That won’t happen unless you eat 1-kilo raw soya \\nevery day continuously for months at a stretch. So there’s nothing to worry about. \\n5. Leptin:\\n Leptin is a vital hormone in your body that’s essential for fat loss. It is like your fuel \\nindicator that signals your brain about the availability of food and based on that \\nyour mind holds on to your body’s fat stores or goes easy on them to release \\nthem for use. That’s directly related to metabolic adaptation (how your body \\ncontrols and varies your metabolism). This hormone goes down when you are on'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'book.pdf', 'page': 46, 'page_label': '47'}, page_content='|  47  \\na caloric deficit for too long, and the effect is more if carbs are omitted from the \\ndiet. This is the reason why a refeed helps. A well-timed and well-placed refeed \\ncan help you lose more by raising your leptin levels after a short dieting phase. \\n6. Ghrelin: \\n This hormone is also known as the hunger hormone. It signals your body to feed it more. \\nThis hormone goes up when are on a caloric deficit for long and are dieting up. That’s \\nwhy you feel hungry. So the next time you feel hungry, don’t think that your body lacks \\nenergy or energy stores. It has a lot of fat stores that it can use. It’s just the ghrelin in action. \\n7. Cortisol:\\n In the fitness community, cortisol is seen as a villain. Truth is, it is neutral. Depends \\non how it functions and the scenario it operates in. It is a catabolic hormone \\nthat helps in the metabolism of fat, protein and carbohydrate – all three. So \\neven your fat loss is dependent on cortisol. However, excess amounts of cortisol \\nfor extended periods is harmful as it can metabolise your muscle mass too. \\nCortisol is released in response to stress and low blood glucose concentration. \\n \\nTIP: Minimize your stress, be on a proper diet and make sure you take your micronutrients. \\nGet involved in activities that you like doing. Pursue a hobby, meditate. It will not just help \\nyou with your cortisol but also lead a good life. My belief is health, not only in your body \\nbut also in your mind.\\nRead more, use logic and question everything that’s happening. That’s the only\\nthe way you’ll benefit your body as well as people around you.\\nI hope this small booklet gave you enough information to start with. Feel free to share it \\namong your friends and family as well.\\nRemember, Fitness is your right, but you have to earn it!\\nCheers, \\nJC'),\n",
